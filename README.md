## Introduction
Agricultural robotics has emerged as a pivotal technology to address the growing demands for efficient, precise, and sustainable farming practices. This project presents the design and development of an innovative agricultural rover aimed at enhancing crop monitoring, environment monitoring, soil analysis, and precision farming.

## Problem Statement
The functionality and efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) depend heavily on the design of effective motor controllers. Conventional control devices have limited capacity to dynamically adjust to changing situations since they rely on preset features and settings. These restrictions can be circumvented by an intelligent motor controller that makes use of machine learning, real-time data processing, and sophisticated programming.

## Objectives
- To create a prototype electric vehicle intended for use in agriculture.
- To develop the electric vehicle prototype’s motor control system.
- To integrate sensors with the vehicle for various agricultural applications.
- To conduct validation testing and showcase the proposed system.

## Design Methodology
The design methodology involves:
1. **Design Principle:** Detailed design principles for the intelligent motor control system.
2. **Circuit Design:** Design of various circuits including PWM Generation (Arduino), Gate Driver Circuit (MCT2E Optocoupler), Motor Driver Circuit (MOSFET H-Bridge), and Battery Power Supply.
3. **Data Monitoring:** Use of ESP32 Circuit for Data Monitoring (DHT11, Blynk).

## Results and Analysis
The results section includes performance analysis and simulation results of the proposed motor controller, comparing it to previous research to verify its efficacy. It demonstrates increased range, smoother acceleration and operation, and optimized torque and speed profiles.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The study concludes with the potential of intelligent motor controllers for electric vehicle applications and suggests areas for further research.
